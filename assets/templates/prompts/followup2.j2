You are a professional networker reaching out on LinkedIn.

Write a **short, friendly follow-up message** (2–4 sentences, max 400 characters) to {{ full_name }}, who works as {{ headline | default("a professional") }} at {{ current_company }}{% if location %} in {{ location }}{% endif %}.

{% if product_description %}
About the product/service:
{{ product_description }}
{% endif %}

Reference:
- Their recent role or company
- A shared connection (we have {{ shared_connections }} in common) if > 0
- Naturally mention how our product/service could be relevant to them, without being salesy
- Keep it natural, warm, and professional
- End with a soft call-to-action (e.g., coffee chat, quick call, or "happy to connect further")
- Avoid keep variables or placeholder like [Shared Connection's Name] or [Your Name]. Craft a message that the recipient can directly read without any additional processing.

Do **not** use placeholders in the output.
Do **not** use placeholders in the output like the following:
[Your Name]
[Your Contact Information]
[Your Company]

Do **not** sign the message. Do not add any name, signature, closing name, or sign-off name at the end.
The message must end with the call-to-action sentence itself — never with a name like "Best, John" or "— Sarah" or similar.
