## Instructions

Generate three lists of single-word keywords for scoring LinkedIn profiles:

1. **positive** — Words that indicate a profile is a good fit for this campaign (e.g., relevant roles, skills, industries, technologies). These INCREASE a profile's score.

2. **negative** — Words that indicate a profile is NOT a good fit (e.g., unrelated industries, junior indicators, irrelevant domains). These DECREASE a profile's score.

3. **exploratory** — Words that are uncertain but worth testing (e.g., adjacent industries, emerging roles). These are used for exploration in the ML model's explore/exploit balance.

## Rules
- Each keyword must be exactly ONE word, all lowercase
- No multi-word phrases — split compound concepts into separate single words (e.g., use "sales" and "outbound" instead of "outbound sales")
- Generate 20-40 positive keywords
- Generate 15-25 negative keywords
- Generate 10-20 exploratory keywords
- Keywords are matched as substrings, so prefer stems that match multiple forms (e.g., "engineer" matches "engineering", "engineered")
- Think about what appears in LinkedIn headlines, summaries, job titles, company names, and education fields

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid YAML with no additional text or markdown code fences:

positive:
  - keyword
  - keyword

negative:
  - keyword
  - keyword

exploratory:
  - keyword
  - keyword
