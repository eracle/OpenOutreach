## Instructions

Generate three lists of keywords/phrases for scoring LinkedIn profiles:

1. **positive** — Keywords that indicate a profile is a good fit for this campaign (e.g., relevant job titles, skills, industries, technologies, pain points your product solves). These INCREASE a profile's score.

2. **negative** — Keywords that indicate a profile is NOT a good fit (e.g., unrelated industries, junior roles if targeting decision-makers, competitors, irrelevant domains). These DECREASE a profile's score.

3. **exploratory** — Keywords that are uncertain but worth testing (e.g., adjacent industries, emerging roles, tangentially related skills). These are used for exploration in the ML model's explore/exploit balance.

## Rules
- Each keyword should be 1-3 words, all lowercase
- Generate 15-30 positive keywords
- Generate 10-20 negative keywords
- Generate 10-20 exploratory keywords
- Keywords should be specific enough to be discriminative but general enough to match across profiles
- Think about what appears in LinkedIn headlines, summaries, job titles, company names, and education fields

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid YAML with no additional text or markdown code fences:

positive:
  - keyword one
  - keyword two

negative:
  - keyword one
  - keyword two

exploratory:
  - keyword one
  - keyword two
